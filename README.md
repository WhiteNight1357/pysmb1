# pysmb1
Making smb1 in python
This project will make full smb1 in python, using pygame(not including glitches).

Currently, there is a resource directory for mario sprite.
In future, there will not be any resource needed for running the game.
Therefore, every spritesheet and level data will be in the code.

Anyway, for contact:
